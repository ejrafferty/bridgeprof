      <p>In the future, I want to be a writer. Today, everyone writes. Everyone types. Everyone texts, everyone emails, everyone Slacks or Discords or maybe writes a handwritten letter for instances of the utmost sincerity or devotion. School assignments are done on laptops, and messages to loved ones are slapped on phone screens. Professionals write reports and draft memos. However, the idiosyncrasies of the usage of the English language draw into question whether or not everyone is a writer. The title of writer requires a past instance of having written something, but is a writer just one who writes? Is a chef just one who cooks? If you run, are you a runner? The simple answer is no. Writer, a term which here means one who writes as an occupation, is most often a self-descriptor. One who regularly writes in exchange for money introduces themselves at house parties as a writer, or maybe as an author, playwright, poet, journalist, technical writer, grant writer, ghostwriter, or whatever term most closely defines the specifics of the speaker’s industry. My problem is that I don’t have an industry to define, much less a shortlist of positions I’d be interested in. In the future, I want to be a writer, but I still have yet to discover what addendum to put onto that term to make it into a comprehensible job title. I want to be a writer, and that’s what all this writing is about: discovery through personal labor. To be clear, it’s not like this indecisiveness or vacillation is a surprise. When I realized in my first year of college that I would want to pursue writing as my field of study, I chose the program that made the most sense to me: Public and Professional Writing—where all the types of writing are lumped into one track, instead of deciding upon which railroad car to be in. I’ve made my bed, and I’m sick of lying in it. So, I am determined to come up with some kind of helpful conclusion about the rest of my life before I’ve lived anything beyond my undergraduate years of college. Call me ambitious.

        <p>In <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, written by co-stars and heartthrobs Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, Damon’s character, the titular Will Hunting, is asked an incisive question by Robin Williams’ character, therapist Sean Maguire: “What do you want to do?” Will, a Bostonian wunderkind struggling to escape his compounded and deeply internalized fears of self-doubt and failure around every corner, finally meets a question that he can’t answer using a quote from an esoteric textbook or Victorian novel. In this context, it’s a challenge from mentor to mentee to look within and discover what really drives someone to act, to feel, to wake up. In other contexts, it’s possibly the most loaded question ever constructed. When someone asks me “What do you want to do?” they are generally only willing to accept an answer that defines my professional or educational life moving forward. Acceptable answers include:
            <ul>
                <li>Graduate School</li>
                <li>Job (don't say food service)</li>
              </ul>
            And that’s it. When my trusted friends who understand my standoffishness from the professional area of life ask “What do you want to do?” I’ll say that I want to be a writer, in some form or another. When my parents ask “What do you want to do?” I can sometimes get away with a cheeky quip of “I guess we’re gonna find out” or something along those lines. But for people not within my circle of trusted comedic subjects, I have to come up with some answer that sounds reasonable and presents me in some kind of newly-adult professional light. My issue is that if I start to say an answer to this question regularly, I feel like I’ll automatically feel obligated to pursue that career path like it’ll just make natural sense to follow this answer that I’ve come up with. Not quite a lie, not quite the truth, and it’ll always be that way if I never choose. With so many options to choose from, and in an era where it’s so common to see young people displaying their success on social media for all to see and silently conflate themselves to, it’s hard not to feel obligated to already have a plan for the future. I'm shooting fish in barrels, but I'm more concerned with finding the perfect trout to put on my LinkedIn page than ever pulling the damn trigger.

        <p>In <i>The Bell Jar</i>, Sylvia Plath describes, far better than I can, similar problems with facing the impossibly different paths of life. Plath canonizes the fleeting future with the analogy of the fig tree: <blockquote> “From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” </blockquote> The impossible weight of these huge choices, albatrosses of fear. Plath’s message is that being unable to choose means losing the opportunity to choose at all, and the indecisiveness I feel at this crossroad is a limit, an obstacle, preventing me from finding a fig that, while maybe not perfect, might just satiate my appetite. Or be so disgusting that I move on to the next sample. With this existentialism in mind, all forms of self-discovery and self-creation are paramount to my mission, the risks are too high to ignore, but the dreams of each possibility are too great to push away. Sylvia Plath ended up picking a fig and is today one of the most celebrated poets and novelists. Plath’s success doesn’t make the coming of my final decision any easier, but it’s nice to know that people have been going through this problem since time immemorial. The way I view my indecision over types of writing careers is through the clear separation of categories: fiction vs. non-fiction, creative or technical, journalistic/personal, public and professional, and so on. But are these separations really so clean-cut? Does choosing one field of writing mean that the skills I’ve developed are useless on the other side of the fence?

<p>In <i>Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly</i>, Anthony Bourdain says “Cooking is a craft, I like to think, and a good cook is a craftsman — not an artist. There's nothing wrong with that: the great cathedrals of Europe were built by craftsmen — though not designed by them.” If the frequency and end goals of cooking make one a chef, then I think the logic can apply to writing too. While writing can be used to create some of the finest art and most intellectually stimulating stories ever told, it is still a craft, or skill, like anything else. Being a good writer, like being a good painter, still requires the ability to expertly use different techniques, to know what to write about, and how to imagine the end result. Like cooking, writing demands a balance of ingredients that must be timed to perfection and can vary across different materials. A prime rib steak and a beef taco aren’t prepared the same way, but a successful meal comes from knowing all sides of the cow. I’m not sure whether or not Sylvia Plath would be a good technical writer working on product patents or describing diagrams, but I think to be a good writer implies that you could handle either fig given the gumption to chew. From this point, developing my writing skills to keep all my options open from an ability perspective will be crucial for future job prospects. It’s one thing to want to be a writer, but it’s a whole other animal to actually be able to succeed. But, once you’ve passed all the writing classes and workshopped your verbiage enough, how do you get started drafting finished pieces?

<p>In a 60 Minutes profile on CBS, author David Grann’s book-writing process is defined by “one constant: exhaustive investigation.” Grann is the mind behind some of this century’s most highly-regarded works of narrative non-fiction based on obscure history, including <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> and <i>The Lost City of Z</i>, and previously worked as a political journalist and creative writing professor. So, a great example of being good at various kinds of writing and being able to approach different angles with a set of baseline skills. But, Grann’s ability to shift between genres and audiences to great success is not my main takeaway from his illustrious career—it’s the sheer and utter devotion to sort through thousands of records and spend years perfecting a book before it hits the shelves. In my time in college, the scale of completed works is much, much more limited. Semester calendars and page limits, not to mention the fact that everything needs to be graded by someone who will read dozens of other submissions to the same prompt. After graduating, the partitions of time will expand to contain months, years, and decades to continue working towards something. However, it’s important to be able to use that time effectively, as a motivator, not a crutch. More of a “what can I do with these next 5 years” than a “I can do it later, I’ve got 5 years.” I hope. Timeliness in college has never been my strong suit, but I’ve boiled it down to the fact that there’s a built-in term limit for everything. Wrapped up in a tight bow, each assignment with point valuations and deadlines and discussion posts that come out to one of five final letters, and when it’s time for you to finish your degree, see you later, alligator. Thanks for paying playing. Post-diploma, embracing the long-term will be a big challenge. But, when nose-to-the-grindstone writers like David Grann are out there, it’s an inspiration to dedicate more than just a few lectures per week to a finished piece. Another important part of Grann’s process is the (sometimes perilous) on-site visits he will make to the locations he is writing about, whether it be the Amazon rainforest or an uninhabited island off the coast of Chile. This level of dedication may be a bit hyperbolic, but it is inspiring to know that there are authors willing to go (literally) the extra mile to create a work they deem worthy. I may never charter a fishing boat to walk in the footsteps of marooned sailors, but I can put my all into a final product that I’m proud of—that’s the ultimate goal.

<p>In Andy Weir’s early professional career, he was a computer programmer, working on software for companies like AOL and Blizzard. But, in the background, he was a writer working on short stories and webcomics, self-published on his own website. Eventually, after some failed attempts and fizzled projects, Weir’s first novel was published: <i>The Martian</i>. It’s now a major motion picture and has sold a bazillion copies, but it didn’t come from out of nowhere. Weir didn’t just decide to write a novel one day and end up being super successful one day, he’s been doing this! The leap from hobby to profession is a difficult trail to navigate, I’m sure. But, that leap is why the little blurb on the page of Google that shows up after you search for Andy Weir doesn’t say “Andrew Taylor Weir is an American computer programmer and amateur writer.” Well, that Andrew Taylor Weir might not have a blurb at all. During an interview with the TED Audio Collective, Weir says that a piece of advice he’ll give to writers is to think of themselves as sculptors, instead of writers, and that the first draft of a work is really just getting the marble to be chiseled and carved into the studio in the first place. Delivering something that barely even resembles a finished product, but with subtle edits, and a chip here and there, the image of the statue comes into place. With Grann’s longevity in mind, and Weir’s admittance that the initial attempts at storytelling mostly end up on the cutting room floor, there is a much grander scale to professional writing than I’ve ever experienced, and I’ll need to build up to it. In that same interview, Weir states that writing is “hard work,” and that he doesn’t “like doing it.” Here, it’s interesting to see one of the most creative sorts of writing, science-fiction novels, still being depicted as difficult labor that requires great effort. Writing isn’t always going to be a beautiful soliloquy, and you don’t only get to write the good parts either. Writing a book is hard. Writing a short story is hard. Writing is still a form of work, and one final important factor to get up to the point of being a professional is to remove the romantic view, the rose-colored glasses that show writing as the ultimate freedom. A job where you could sit in a picturesque cabin with a typewriter and come down a few months later to a briefcase with one million dollars in exchange for your thoughts. Writing is a job that requires skills and training, not to mention all the stuff outside of putting words on paper, like navigating the publishing industry and finding an editor or feeding yourself until you start making money. I shouldn’t want to write because it’s easy, or potentially offers more freedom than a 9-5. I should want to write because I believe in the full process, the gory details, and the eventual beautiful result.

<p>In my own words, I’ve said that I want to be a writer. I’ve almost finished college with this particular goal in mind of being able to harness my talents for word arrangement and Google searching synonyms into a job, or a form of personal expression. In other words I’ve found and cited here, it won’t be easy, but it’s the “choice” I’ll have to make to see if this whole thing ends up being something. It’s not so much the “choosing” as it is the “doing.” The classic adage of “you are what you do” negates any function of “I wish I was doing this” or “maybe someday I’ll work on that.” The process of being a writer starts with doing the writing, and the gun fires whenever I choose to start the marathon. No matter the place I find myself in twenty or thirty years, finding fulfillment is at the heart of what I’d like to discover, or create. That comes through effort, not sitting and waiting for the perfect opportunity where everything is safe and set up for me to already succeed. Life can be a walk in the park if you’re willing to take on the speed limit, but am I setting unrealistic expectations for myself? Do I continue to romanticize a future of success through writing that is always out of reach, and never accept the truth that writing isn’t just something you can “choose” to start being successful at? There’s still only one way to find out: to do it. One of my college professors gave me the advice that it’s good to go through careers that might be more precarious or insecure, albeit more exciting and spirit-building, while you’re young, or while you don’t have a mortgage. With rent prices where they are now, I don’t know how sincerely I can support or believe in that advice, but I think I know where it’s coming from: I’m young, despite how ancient I feel. I’ve got years ahead of me, God willing, and figuring out how to best use them will be the greatest existential challenge I’ll face.

<p>In The Fellowship of the Ring, wizard Gandalf admits to hobbit Frodo Baggins that the period that one lives in is “not for them to decide. All [they] have to decide is what to do with the time that is given.” Gandalf’s classic sayings drive many of the iconic moments within Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series, but none sum up the ultimate power that choosing what to do with your life contains within the unlimited possibilities quite like this particular instance. There are no mentions of dark lords or fire demons, and while the stakes of Gandalf and Frodo’s time are fantastically high, the same question lies upon the shoulders of everyone who passes through this plane. There is no correct answer, and the future is muddled with all of the potential options.But, this much is clear: I’m not Will Hunting. I’m not Sylvia Plath, or Anthony Bourdain, or David Grann, or Andy Weir. And I’m definitely not Gandalf. I can cite and reflect on their writing willy-nilly, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m not them. I’m Evan Rafferty, and I have to write my own words. I have my whole life in front of me to figure out which fig to eat, which job to take, and which stories to tell. Right now, it’s about finding a way out of the quicksand and trying on a new shoe to see how it feels. I want to do <i>this</i>—report on a local story, write painfully personal essays, consider great thinkers, apply new ways of knowing, discover forgotten tales, advocate for causes, explain a mechanical function, describe leaves on a tree, and explore the human condition. I want to be a writer. In so doing, I become.
